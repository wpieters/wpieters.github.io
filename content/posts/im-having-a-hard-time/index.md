This probably isn't the place for it. But if you are following and supporting the project, and waiting on updates, then it is relevant.

I'm guessing most solo devs go through this at some point, probably multiple times. And I suppose their "why" for creating their game is a big part of what keeps them going. But I am struggering right now.

Doing this as a side project is hard. And knowing that I don't have all the skills I need, and need to keep learning makes it harder. Normally, I don't mind that. I enjoy a challenge. I welcome it. Growth happens outside your comfort zone.

But every now and then, something happens that makes me question everything.

Like some random dude on the internet making a game with AI which I would consider janky as hell and not worth anything more than a novelty glance, already breaking $1000 and people actually buying useless in-game items.

Like, how do you compete with that? How do you put in hours/days/weeks/months of actual effort to build something you think is good and that people will actually enjoy, and then some rando with a laptop throws out POS after POS to see what sticks and then actually makes something off it…

Maybe I'm just not cut out for this.

I want to keep working on this. I probably will. I think it's a novel idea that needs some feedback and polish, and it's been nagging at me for years, but I really believe there is something here.

But damn, real talk; I don't think I've been this bleak about building anything in my 20+ years of development…
