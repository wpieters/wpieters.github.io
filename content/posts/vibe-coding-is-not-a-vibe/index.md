I've been playing around with Cursor and Windsurf, because I keep seeing on social media how great these tools are and how easy it is to build things. And you know what? It's.... ummm... better than before?

Okay, look, it's impressive. If I compare it so some earlier versions of the IDEs and other tools like Bolt.new, sure, it's improved. But sheesh, does it take poking and prodding and coddling to get somewhere. Maybe I'm using it wrong, I don't know, but I wish I could share the transcripts of my chats with these tools so you'll understand... (can I export those? am I missing a feature somewhere?)

It gets to a point where the number of times I tell it "no that fix made it worse" GREATLY outweighs the times I'm thinking "damn that's cool". And I'm left wondering... is this just a limitation of the current state of the tools and models, or are these tools being purposefully made dumb so we keep using our credits and are forced into paying for more expensive tiers. Like Pro isn't enough because I have to tell it 9 times to fix the same issue, so maybe I should be paying for Business or Enterprise?

In today's capitalistic society where everything is about making a quick buck or more bucks, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case... ðŸ¤‘

So yeah, cool tools, interesting use cases, but I'm not throwing away my Jetbrains subscription yet, and I'll keep learning new tools and frameworks the old school way for now; by building things, breaking things, and fixing things.

That said, if you are curious about the first two projects (the third is a bit more ambitious, so wait for that one), you can view them here:
