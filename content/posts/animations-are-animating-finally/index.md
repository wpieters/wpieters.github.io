Okay, small update again, just want to keep this up showing there is progress. I've made some tweaks to the skills and I can now add the VFX animations and particle effects to it, and there are some things I can tweak to make it a bit more visually appealing. 

{{< youtube P45_3Cu2ibQ >}}

I do however still see some weirdness, with things not being centered when I expect them too, or other animations being way too small. I'm going add something to scale those effects, and also have them get bigger as you level up the skills.

I also noticed that when I changed the Font the text for the upgrade screens have gotten really small, so once I fix that along with the last animation tweaks, I'll be doing another release before moving on to the next big thing; refactoring the combat engine.

All these weird little timing issues are annoying me, and not being able to speed up or skip over things as well, so I want to overhaul it completely. This will be a major refactoring, so I want to get something working released and tagged in my source code.

Wish me luck.
