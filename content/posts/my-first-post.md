# New Blog FTW!

Hello! I'm excited to continue sharing my thoughts and experiences through this new blog. I've migrated my content to Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator, with the beautiful PaperMod theme.

## What to Expect

I'll continue writing about various topics that interest me, including:

- Technology and programming
- Personal projects
- Thoughts and experiences
- Gaming and other hobbies
- And much more!

Stay tuned as I migrate my existing content and add new posts!

## Oh, also

I migrated this entire thing using Cursor. I'll probably do a post on that as well, since I've been using Cursor and Windsurf for more simplistic projects and I have opinions üòè
