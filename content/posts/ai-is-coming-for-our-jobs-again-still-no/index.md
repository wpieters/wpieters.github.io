ü§ñ I love how every new LLM release triggers a wave of "AI is coming for your job!" posts, only for people to realize a few weeks later "oh, nope, sorry, not this yet" üòè

üí° While AI tools are certainly force multipliers for productivity, even with agents, they're not replacing humans yet. Even the best apps I've generated with Bolt or Replit eventually need human intervention and fixing.

üéØ Hot take incoming: I find it amusing when people consider these simplistic example AI-generated "apps" as "real development". Most modern webapps are already essentially just careful combinations of frameworks and styling, using existing tools that solve problems in generic ways. That's not novel software development. 

‚ö° Why? Because today's app demands make it logical to build on existing foundations rather than starting from scratch. Nothing wrong with that! And yes, some AI tools excel at this. But here's the kicker - those AI tools you claim are better than junior devs? Built by humans. Trained by humans. Those frameworks the AIs are using? Same thing.

ü§î Basically every blog or sample project I see as the example of these tools "doing the work of developers" are basic tutorial level sample projects. So yeah, wake me up when AI builds the next React, creates and scales the next AWS, or develops an OS to replace Linux.

Until then, I'll keep coding. üíª
