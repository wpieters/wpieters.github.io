Don't trust the salesperson. Trust the user reviews.

When billionaires share their "secrets to success," they're selling to people who'll never have their starting advantages. When AI executives tell everyone to "learn to code," they're ignoring billions without basic internet access. When tech companies promise their products will make us smarter, research often suggests the opposite may be true.

Yes, innovation matters. Ford's customers might have asked for faster horses instead of cars. But here's the difference: when someone's paycheck depends entirely on selling you something, when their company's survival hinges on that sale, they're not solving your problem, they're solving theirs.

I'd rather hear from the actual users. And increasingly from what I see, they're calling BS on a lot of these promises.

The most honest product feedback doesn't come from keynotes or earnings calls. It comes from the people actually living with these technologies every day.

So thank you to all the random and close connections sharing their thought and experiences. Because I just can't trust any "influencer" or "top voice" anymore...
