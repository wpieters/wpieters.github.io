ðŸŽ¯ This morning's YouTube recommendation: someone coding purely by voice using Cursor agents and Windows dictation tools.

My first thought? Not "wow, how cool!" but "seriously, is typing that hard now!?" ðŸ™„

My second thought: "Good luck remote debugging a Linux server at 1am to fix what your AI buddy broke..."

First we outsource thinking to AI, now the typing... it's like nobody *wants* to actually do this job anymore! ðŸ¤¦ 

But here's the thing - after my initial skepticism, I realized this IS actually pretty cool. Just not for the reasons filling up your social media feed.

ðŸŒŸ This is AMAZING for accessibility. I've worked with blind developers and known others whose carpal tunnel and RSI have severely impacted their ability to code traditionally. If AI can help these developers continue their craft and be their best selves, I'm completely on board.

ðŸ’¡ So why are we so focused on letting AI replace our work when it could be an incredible force multiplier for those who face real barriers to entry?
