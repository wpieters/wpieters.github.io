It's been a long few months, so I'll keep this short.

Windows, MacOS and Android builds are working, Linux still has issues, so I'll work on that.

But‚Ä¶

LOL, not really, this is just the beginning!

The game has most of the mechanics there; equippable skills, turn based combat, ultimate skills, skill unlocks, dice roll mechanics.

But it needs more, and it needs balancing. More enemies, more skills, more bigger dice.

I also want to add damage types and weakness and resistance. The game needs a story and exploration.

So much more to do.

But I'd love your feedback. Tell me if this is worth pursuing further, please üòê
