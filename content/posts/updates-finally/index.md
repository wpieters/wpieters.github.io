Here it is folks, a new release with a few features and bugfixes ðŸŽ‰

I did not test the Android version on an actual phone, having trouble with the Android device I use for testing, so there may be some issuesâ€¦ Screen layouts have been in issue in the past because of the different aspect ratios. Just let me know in the comments if you have problems, Iâ€™ll try and test ASAP.

As mentioned before, Iâ€™ve been mainly focused on adding some of the alpha features I didnâ€™t finish up last time, which includes VFX for the skills and some tweaks to the UI. Keen-eyed observers will notice I skipped 0.5aâ€¦ I made the builds with the VFX changes, but not the bug fixes, and ended up not uploading them because of a pretty big bug ðŸ™ˆ

So with this release Iâ€™ve got some things in a good place and I can start working on some of the larger items I want in place before moving on to the Beta version of the game. For context, when Iâ€™m talking about the Alpha, this for me focuses on the core mechanics and infrastructure I need before moving on to the actual game, which will be the Beta version.

The main things I want to focus on next, probably not in this order, weâ€™ll see

- Controller Support (which probably means redoing the input scheme and Options menu)
- D8 Dice UI (the idea is that you can upgrade your dice over runs, the D8 will be upgrade for the D6)
- Second character (which will probably include a character selection screen, with the idea that different characters have different Ultimates and different default dice layouts)
- Turn and Combat flow improvements (including the option to skip text and increase gameplay speed, this is a big one, since it means completely refactoring this class to use events for everything)
- Camera animations for idle and attacks (a big one Iâ€™ve wanted to add for a while, but beyond my current expertise, need to watch some tutorialsâ€¦)

Iâ€™m sure there are other things on the Trello, but not that I can remember off the top of my head.
