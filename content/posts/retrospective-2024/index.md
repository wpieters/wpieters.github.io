🌱 As 2024 enters the rear-view mirror and we look forward to 2025, this is usually an opportune time to reflect and plan. Those who know me personally are aware that 2024 was a challenging year with personal loss and challenges in the extended family, as well as some health issues, but it was also one with opportunity and challenges (some I chose for myself).

💼 I'm extremely grateful for the support I've received after starting PiForge. It's been an amazing start for a new company, and while the last few months have been challenging with deadlines and extra hours, I look forward to what that means for the future.

🏡 Beyond PiForge, my wife and I have also moved to a smallholding in 2022 where we've upgraded our little "urban farming" dream into a full-blown perma-culture food forest homestead, and this has not been without its challenges (and rewards) as well.

🎯 All this has meant that some of my goals for 2024 have been pushed aside as I focused on what needed the most immediate attention. With 2025 just kicking off, I'm hoping to get back into content creation, as I'd love to revive my YouTube and Twitch channels, perhaps with less of a gaming focus and more of a dev focus. I also really want to continue development of my indie game, "So this is how I DIE", so perhaps I can livestream these sessions; two birds and all that. While this is probably a bit ambitious, I would love to find another contract or two for PiForge and get to a point where I can hire another developer to help out.

🚀 Ultimately, I want to grow PiForge into more than just consulting, as I have tools, apps, and games I've been wanting to build for some time. If we can slowly start focusing on those more and more, I will consider the year a success.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of my journey thus far. I appreciate you all, and I look forward to what we can accomplish in 2025. May you be blessed this year. 🙏
