And neither does development on this game apparently 😅

This is just a quick general update to say that I'm finally resuming development on this game. I still have a lot of bugs and improvements to figure out before I start adding more content, but I'm finally in a position where I can spend a day or two a week on this, as opposed to an hour here and an hour there.

With that said, I won't be setting any hard deadlines yet, as I'm still figuring out my exact capacity and schedule, but I would very much like to get the bugfixes that were raised with me out before the end of August if possible.

Very excited to be back and working on this again 😁
