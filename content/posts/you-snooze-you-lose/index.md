Just a quick general update, I'm still working on bugs, I've got some ironed out, but found a few more small ones, should have a new build out by end of week.

The plan after the bugfixes are to tackle the font issues that were raised, as well as resizing the UI to make free up more space for visuals. For the latter I'll probably look at moving more information to tooltips instead of a big info window.

What I'd actually like to get to after that, rather than working on the VFX and improved turns state machine, which was the original plan, is actually to add controller support. The main reason here is very selfish; I recently purchased a ROG Ally X and I want my game to play better on it üòù

Okay, then on to the subject... When I started working on this game, I couldn't find anything similar. While my inspiration game from a board game (Dice Forge), I didn't find many video games that had a similar mechanic.

Until today.

I saw a trailer for Astrea: Six-Sided Oracles, which by the way looks freaking amazing and I'll totally be buying it, but... the concept seemed very similar to mine, modify a 6-sided die and roll for effects in a turn based combat format.

Now, I've had this idea for years, and I don't know how long they've been working on their game, but I kinda feel like I missed an opportunity here. This was a unique idea (as far as I could tell), which now no longer is. Which saddens me a little.

That said, I still think my tiny little game has potential, and I'll keep developing it.

Anyway, go check out their trailer, it looks really good:

UPDATE:

Made some progress tonight, finally fixed a bug where player health was not reset between runs, and also tweaked the UI a bit. Mostly font changes and then moving items around, hopefully to give more real-estate, but also the button layout now mimics an Xbox controller.

Still more I want to do, like making it obvious when your ultimate is ready, and I was thinking about adding something to indicate turn order, but then I realised that at the moment order is fixed, so what's the point even üôÉ
