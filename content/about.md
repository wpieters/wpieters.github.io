Software engineering consultant with over 15 years of industry experience and 30+ years of passion for technology. Starting from BASIC on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, I've grown through various technologies including Java, Groovy, Scala, Go, and cloud development.

After years in enterprise systems and cloud architecture, I now focus on helping companies build better infrastructure, processes, and teams. I specialize in architecture, DevOps, and process optimization, while still enjoying hands-on coding.

My broad knowledge base, coupled with a dedication to continuous learning and improving the entire software development lifecycle, drives me to help companies grow and learn from common industry mistakes.
