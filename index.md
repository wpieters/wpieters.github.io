## Welcome to Wynand Pieters Consulting

I started my consulting company after being retrenched from my last startup. Going through that and learning from mistakes I've seen made, I decided to help other companies focus on getting the right infrastructure, processes, tooling and people in place for success.

### Services

I focus on consulting, primarily on architecture, DevOps and process, but I do have years of coding experience and still love to get my hands dirty, so I do freelance development as well. I'm happy to have a chat and find out if I can help you in any way.

You can learn more about my experience and how to contact me from my [About](/about) page.
