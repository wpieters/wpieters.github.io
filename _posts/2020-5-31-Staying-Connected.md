### Introduction

In this post, I will be going through some steps we've taken at the one company where I'm working to help people stay more connected during our Lockdown period.

South Africa very quickly imposed very quick lockdowns when COVID cases started climbing, modelling their ideas on other countries (notably New Zealand), and movement and industry was heavily restricted.

As we transitioned to fully remote, a lot changed for us. Our morning socialising at the coffee machines stopped. We could no longer walk over to another teams desk area and ask a question. People couldn't easily get together to quickly chat about something. Sure, tools like Zoom and Google Meet help with this, but they are often cumbersome to set up, especially with all the additional security measures we need these days. And yes, we can do a lot over Slack, but sometimes you need a face to face, and you want the barrier of entry to be low.
